# 3projetos-bonieky-live

3 projects made with HTML, CSS, and JS, in the live class taught by the instructor Boniek Lacerda, on YouTube. 

The first project is a 'clone' of the interface and functionality of the Brazilian electronic ballot box.

The second is a simple slider.

The third is a form validation, that serves as a model for future uses.
